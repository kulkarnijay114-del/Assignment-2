🔹 OObjective
To understand what makes a password strong and test it using online password strength checkers (e.g., passwordmeter.com).
Tools Used
•	Password Strength Checker: passwordmeter.com
Step 1: Create Multiple Passwords with Varying Complexity
Here are some example passwords for testing:
1.	apple (simple, lowercase only)
2.	Apple123 (mixed case + numbers)
3.	@pple123! (symbols + mixed case + numbers)
4.	Str0ng@P4ssw0rd!2025 (long, mixed characters, complex)
Step 2 & 3: Test Passwords on Strength Checker
Password	Score/Strength (from tool)	Feedback/Notes
apple	Very Weak (0–10%)	Too short, only lowercase letters
Apple123	Weak/Moderate (~40–50%)	Improved by numbers & case, but still predictable
@pple123!	Strong (~70–80%)	Good mix of symbols, case, numbers
Str0ng@P4ssw0rd!2025	Very Strong (~90–100%)	Excellent: long length, symbols, numbers, uppercase/lowercase
Step 4: Best Practices for Creating Strong Passwords
1.	Use at least 12–16 characters.
2.	Include uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols.
3.	Avoid dictionary words, names, or obvious patterns.
4.	Use passphrases (e.g., “T!gerRunsFast2025!”).
5.	Do not reuse passwords across accounts.
Step 5: Tips Learned from Evaluation
•	Short and simple passwords are easily broken.
•	Adding numbers and symbols dramatically increases strength.
•	Length matters: longer passwords are much harder to crack.
•	Randomness > predictable substitutions (e.g., Pa$$w0rd is still weak).
Step 6: Common Password Attacks
•	Brute Force Attack: Tries every possible combination until it finds the password (short/simple ones fall quickly).
•	Dictionary Attack: Uses common words or leaked password lists.
•	Hybrid Attack: Combines dictionary words with variations (like Password123).
Step 7: How Password Complexity Affects Security
•	Passwords with only lowercase letters are very weak and can be cracked within seconds.
•	Adding numbers, uppercase, and symbols increases the time needed for cracking.
•	Longer, more complex passwords (especially random passphrases) can take years or centuries to crack with brute force.
 Conclusion:
Password strength depends mainly on length, complexity, and unpredictability. A good practice is to use long passphrases with a mix of characters, and never reuse passwords across accounts.
