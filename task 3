1) Quick overview + tools you’ll use
•	Objective: Find common vulnerabilities on your machine and document the most critical ones.
•	Primary tools (free for home use):
o	Nessus Essentials — easy to use GUI scanner (free for home/personal). Good beginner friendly option.
o	Nmap — fast port + service discovery + vulnerability NSE scripts.
o	Nikto — web server vulnerability scanner (if you run web services locally).
o	Lynis — Linux host auditing (if you scan a Linux machine).
o	(Optional) OpenVAS / GVM — Greenbone’s free scanner (strong but more setup-heavy). Consider using Kali Linux which bundles it or a Greenbone Docker image.
•	What you’ll deliver: vulnerability scan report (see template below) + screenshots of scan results.
2) Prep: find your local IP and basic checks
•	Windows: open PowerShell / cmd:
o	ipconfig → note your IPv4 address (e.g., 192.168.1.100)
o	netstat -an (see listening ports)
•	Linux/macOS:
o	ip addr or ifconfig or hostname -I → note IP
o	ss -tuln or netstat -tuln
Decide target: use 127.0.0.1 or localhost to scan the local machine, or the local IP if you plan to scan from another device on your LAN.
3) Install & run (step-by-step)
A — Nessus Essentials (easy GUI)
1.	Sign up for Nessus Essentials (Tenable offers a free activation key for personal use). Download the installer for your OS from Tenable’s site (search “Nessus Essentials”).
2.	Install:
o	Windows: run the .msi and follow the installer.
o	Linux: install the appropriate .rpm/.deb and start the nessusd service.
3.	Open your browser to https://localhost:8834 (or the host+port the installer gives).
4.	Activate with the free activation code emailed to you, create an admin account.
5.	Create a Basic Network Scan:
o	New Scan → Basic Network Scan.
o	Target: 127.0.0.1 (or your local IP).
o	Save → Launch.
6.	Review results in the web UI. Export PDF/HTML or take screenshots.
Notes: Nessus has comprehensive plugins and gives CVSS scores, plugin IDs, and remediation suggestions per finding.
B — Nmap (fast reconnaissance + quick vuln checks)
Install:
•	Windows: download from nmap.org (use the installer which includes zenmap GUI optionally).
•	Linux/macOS: sudo apt install nmap (Ubuntu/Debian) or brew install nmap on macOS.
Useful commands (run from a terminal):
•	Quick port + service scan:
nmap -sS -sV -p- 127.0.0.1
•	Quick default scripts + service versions:
nmap -sC -sV 127.0.0.1
•	Run Nmap vulnerability scripts (takes longer):
nmap --script vuln 127.0.0.1
•	Target other host on LAN:
sudo nmap -sS -sV -p- -T4 192.168.1.100
Interpretation: -sV reports service + version; --script vuln runs NSE scripts that look for known weak configs. Use results to prioritize targets in Nessus/OpenVAS.
C — Nikto (if you run web servers locally)
Install (Linux/macOS):
sudo apt install nikto     # or download from cirt.net/nikto
nikto -h http://127.0.0.1:80
Nikto finds outdated web server headers, common files, insecure scripts.
D — OpenVAS / GVM (if you want an alternative)
•	Recommended route: use Kali Linux (it includes GVM/OpenVAS) or follow Greenbone official docs. GVM gives full vulnerability database like Nessus but setup is heavier. If you’re comfortable with Docker, there are maintained GVM images you can run; check Greenbone docs for the current, official image and setup instructions.
4) Authenticated scans (strongly recommended)
Authenticated scans inspect configuration/patch levels — more accurate than unauthenticated scans.
•	Windows target: supply local admin credentials to Nessus/OpenVAS.
o	Enable Windows remote management options (WinRM) and ensure firewall allows it. Many scanners can use SMB / WMI if you provide DOMAIN\username and password. (Use a dedicated scan account with admin rights.)
•	Linux target: add an account for scanning (or use SSH key). Ensure sshd is running and the account can sudo for checks if requested.
•	In Nessus: scan policy → credentials → add Windows / SSH credentials. In OpenVAS: similar credentials tab.
5) Interpreting results — what to look for
Scanners will give severity (Critical/High/Medium/Low/Info) and usually a CVSS score.
Prioritize:
1.	Critical / High findings on Internet-exposed services (RDP, SSH, SMB, web servers).
2.	Local privilege escalation or unpatched OS vulnerabilities.
3.	Default credentials / account misconfigurations.
4.	Unnecessary open ports/services.
For each finding, the scanner gives:
•	Title/Description
•	Affected asset (IP/hostname + port)
•	CVSS / severity
•	Remediation suggestion (patch/upgrad e/disable service)
•	References (vendor patch links, CVE)
6) Common fixes & quick mitigations
•	Apply OS and application updates (Windows Update / apt update && apt upgrade).
•	Remove or disable unused services (SMBv1, Telnet, old FTP).
•	Close unnecessary ports in firewall; restrict access to services to trusted IPs.
•	Replace default/weak passwords; use 2FA where possible.
•	Limit accounts with administrative privileges.
•	Configure secure protocols (disable weak ciphers, enable TLS 1.2+ for services).
•	For web apps: update CMS/plugins, use security headers, disable directory listing.
7) Validate fixes
After remediation, re-run the same scan (or re-scan the specific host/ports) and confirm the finding’s status changed to resolved.
8) Deliverables — what to include in your report
Your deliverable should contain:
•	Scan metadata (tool, version, scan date/time, target IP/hostname, type of scan — authenticated or not).
•	Executive summary (top 3 critical issues, overall risk posture).
•	Detailed findings table (see template below).
•	Screenshots of scanner output.
•	Remediation steps and verification plan.
•	Re-scan date planned.
9) Ready-to-use report template (copy/paste into doc or spreadsheet)
ID	Title	Severity	CVSS	Affected Host:Port	Description	Evidence (screenshot/log)	Recommended Fix	Status (Open/Fixed)
1	Missing OS security updates	Critical	9.0	192.168.1.100	System missing recent security updates; exposes RCE CVEs	screenshot_nessus_1.png	Apply latest OS updates; reboot	Open
2	RDP exposed, weak encryption	High	8.2	192.168.1.100:3389	RDP requires weaker cipher/NLA disabled	nmap_rdp.png	Require NLA, limit by firewall, enable MFA	Open
3	Outdated Apache version	Medium	6.5	127.0.0.1:80	Apache version X.X has directory traversal issue	nikto_apache.png	Update Apache to latest patch	Fixed
4	Open SSH with weak ciphers	Medium	5.6	192.168.1.100:22	SSH allows weak ciphers/KEX	nmap_ssh.png	Update sshd_config to disable weak ciphers	Open
(You can add CVE numbers if scanner shows them. Keep screenshots named consistently.)
10) Short checklist that follows your hint list
1.	Install Nessus Essentials or OpenVAS (or both) + Nmap.
2.	Set scan target to 127.0.0.1 or your local IP.
3.	Start full vulnerability scan (use Basic Network Scan in Nessus or full/default policy).
4.	Wait for scan to finish (typical scans may take some time depending on scope).
5.	Review report — sort by severity and exposure (Internet-facing services first).
6.	Research mitigations for the top findings (vendor KBs, official patches).
7.	Document the most critical vulnerabilities in the report template above.
8.	Take screenshots of scan results (Nessus: Export → PDF, or use screenshot tool).
11) Quick commands & references you can paste/run now
•	Nmap quick service & vuln script:nmap -sC -sV --script vuln 127.0.0.1
•	Discover open ports only:nmap -p- 127.0.0.1
•	Nikto (web server): nikto -h http://127.0.0.1:80
•	Lynis (Linux system audit):sudo apt install lynis sudo lynis audit system
12) Final notes & safety
•	Don’t scan networks/computers you don’t own. Unauthorized scanning can be illegal.
•	When using credentials for authenticated scans, protect those credentials and delete them from scanner configs if the scanner is on a shared machine.
•	If you find high-risk vulnerabilities that you cannot fix, isolate the machine (disconnect from network) until patched.
